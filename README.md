This is a work-in-progress plugin for prettier to support formatting of
PostgreSQL-flavour SQL, including formatting view and function bodies as SQL,
PL/pgSQL, Python (plpython), JavaScript (plv8) etc.

## Guiding principles

Try and match pg_dump-style capitalisation and word order, but with prettier
line-wrapping/indentation.

- Capitalise keywords
- Use lower case for case-insensitive identifiers (table/column/function/etc
  names)
- Only escape case-insensitive identifiers if they are reserved words
- Always escape identifiers if they are reserved words
- Always escape case-sensitive identifiers (obviously)
- Where a statement can be expressed in many orders, express it in the same
  order that `pg_dump` would
- Try not to add/remove things (e.g. functions are volatile by default, mark
  them as `VOLATILE` in the output if and only if they were marked as such in
  the input (otherwise omit))
- Be safe! If we don't understand something, throw an error - don't just carry
  on regardless!

## How to use it

Don't! We're not ready yet!

```
git clone git@github.com:benjie/prettier-plugin-pg.git
cd prettier-plugin-pg
yarn
```

Then compile the source (watch flag is optional):

```
yarn tsc --watch
```

And in another terminal:

```
yarn test
```

## How it works / history

We use [pg-query-native](https://github.com/zhm/node-pg-query-native) which uses
[libpq_query](https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query) to parse the SQL using the
same parser code that PostgreSQL uses internally.

We then took
[the deparser from pg-query-parser](https://github.com/pyramation/pg-query-parser/blob/8a83b18bfd3ff85d40f10ea1d679e4605a8b1022/src/deparser.js)
as the foundation for the printer, and converted it from using strings
internally to using prettier's formatting commands. [This is where we're working
currently.]

We've not got this far yet, but next we'll be adding a library of tests (if you
have any particularly tricky SQL, please submit it!) to ensure that nothing is
corrupted.

Finally we'll be optimising the formatting of the output queries - putting the
`group`s and `line`s in the correct places.

## Status

Very much a work in progress - do NOT use this for basically ANYTHING yet, we've
got a long way to go.

## Contributing

Help would be very much appreciated - just jot down in an issue what you'd like
to do and if you get the nod (which tends to be fairly prompt!) then please send
a PR. Issues will be opened up to other contributors after a short period of
inactivity, so you're encouraged to open a PR before it's ready to merge, just
mark it as `[WIP]` in the PR title.
